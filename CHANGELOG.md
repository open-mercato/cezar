# Unreleased

## ⚠️ Breaking
- **The HTTP API moved to `/api/v1`.** Every route answers under `/api/v1/…` (project-scoped:
  `/api/v1/p/<projectId>/…`) and the WebSocket bus is `/api/v1/ws`; the unversioned `/api/*`
  spelling is gone. The bundled cockpit ships in lockstep, so a normal upgrade needs nothing from
  you — this only matters if you script the API directly, where the fix is adding `/v1`.
  `GET /api/v1/health` is still the CORS-open discovery endpoint, historical run transcripts keep
  rendering (old image URLs are upgraded when read), and saved bookmarklets are unaffected.
  Versioning is what lets the typed client describe the whole surface and makes a future `v2` an
  additive mount rather than an edit to every route.

## ✨ Features
- ✨ **The two mixed-format routes do real HTTP content negotiation.** `GET /api/v1/repo/commit/:sha`
  (legacy text blob or structured commit payload) and `GET /api/v1/runs/:id/files` (JSON listing or
  an image's raw bytes) now honour the request's `Accept` header, answer `Vary: Accept`, and set a
  `Content-Type` confirming what they actually sent. Purely additive: the `?structured=`/`?raw=`
  flags still decide whenever the request carries one, `*/*` (what `fetch` and `curl` send) is read
  as "no preference" and keeps each route's existing default, so every current caller's answer is
  byte-identical. What is new is that a client that really does ask — an `<img>`, a browser
  navigation — gets the other representation without the flag, under the same allowlist, size cap
  and sandbox CSP as before.

## 🔧 Changed
- Every mutating route is now visible to the typed client, `POST /api/v1/todos/:id/start` included.
  Its body used to be parsed inside the handler to keep "unknown id 404s before the body is
  validated"; a small existence guard registered *before* the body validator keeps that status
  order while the body becomes part of the route type. A bodyless POST still 201s and a malformed
  one still 400s.
- **Validation errors (`400 {error}`) are worded differently and now name the field.** Two causes:
  zod 4 rewrote its default messages (`Required` → `Invalid input: expected string, received
  undefined`), and each issue is now prefixed with its path — `task: must be at most 100000
  characters` where it used to be `task must be at most 100000 characters` for a handful of fields
  and an unattributed sentence for the rest. **The `{ error: string }` shape and the 400 status are
  unchanged**, and the message was never a pinned contract (BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md §2 pins the
  shape, not the text) — but a script matching on the exact wording will need updating, and the
  cockpit shows the new text verbatim in its toasts.
- Every mutating route now validates its body as route middleware rather than inside the handler,
  and the query string / path params of 17 more routes are validated too. Behaviour is unchanged
  by design, including the tolerant cases (a body sent without a JSON content-type, a malformed
  body, and a repeated query key such as `?refresh=1&refresh=1`, which still takes the first
  value). The point is that the typed client can now check request bodies, params and queries at
  compile time.

## 🐛 Fixes
- 🐛 **Running the test suite no longer wipes your project registry.** A merge-write resolved
  `~/.cezar/config.json` twice — once to read, once to write, after the `await` — and
  `cezarHomeDir()` re-reads `CEZ_HOME` on every call, so a test that lost its sandbox pin
  mid-flight (a timeout was enough) read the temp home and wrote the real one, replacing every
  project with the fixture's. The path is now resolved once per merge-write, the whole server
  suite runs with `CEZ_HOME` pinned to a per-worker sandbox, and a write into the real `~/.cezar`
  from a vitest process is refused outright. The same one-path fix lands in the `ui-state.json` twin.
- 🐛 **The registry survives a lost config file.** Every merge-write that leaves projects behind
  also writes `~/.cezar/config.json.bak`, and cezar restores from that snapshot when the config
  file is missing, empty, or corrupt. Removing `~/.cezar` still resets cezar completely; removing
  only `config.json` no longer loses the project list. A config that parses and is simply empty is
  left alone — that is a user who removed their last project, not a lost registry.

# 0.9.1 (2026-07-24)

## Highlights
A stabilization release that hardens single-project mode and sharpens the cockpit. Project edits and the registry are now correctly gated and isolated when `CEZ_SINGLE_PROJECT` is set (#625, #626), the diff and task commit list are virtualized for snappier scrolling on large runs (#599), and browser tabs finally carry project-aware titles (#543). Codex sessions read more clearly with labeled image-view tool calls and context compaction (#593, #596), while streamed deltas coalesce into whole text events (#633). A batch of run-fidelity fixes keeps task titles, issue-number provenance, and tool issue links accurate (#623, #539, #538).
